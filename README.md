# Spatially Mapping Locoregional Cancer Recurrence 

A Python-based framework for patient data classification and treatment planning analysis using scikit-rt.

## Overview
This project provides a set of tools for processing, classifying, and analysing patient imaging and treatment data using Scikit-RT. It includes modules for:
- **Patient data import and management**: Loads patient imaging and associated metadata.
- **Image registration**: Aligns medical images from different scans to a common reference frame.
- **Structure transformation**: Adjusts structures to match registered images.
- **Dose prescription analysis**: Compares treatment plans and radiation doses to expected values.
- **Classification of recurrence structures**: Identifies recurrence patterns based on dose response.
- **Visualisation of treatment planning data**: Generates plots and overlays structures onto images.

## Features
- Uses Python package **scikit-rt** for performing image registration of planning CT and relapse CT scans for radiotherapy patients. 
- Determines the optimal spatial mapping transform, and stores the results of the registration in a results directory defined by the user. 
- Spatially maps structures outlined by clinicians from the relapse CT to the planning CT for comparison with radiotherapy dose field data.
- Applies uncertainty quantification methods to determine error in spatial mapping transform and applies to the centroid of the mapped recurrence volume.
- Generates synthetic spherical structure around the recurrence centroid with radius of the quantified uncertainty for comparison to planned radiotherapy dose field. 
- Classifies recurrence based on spatial location and dose delivered to the recurrence sphere. 
- Outputs patient classification data for further analysis. 
- Provides visualisation tools for treatment planning evaluation and comparison with other treatment covariates. 

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10.13
- scikit-rt 0.7.2
 
For further details on the installation of scikit-rt please reference the [scikit-rt repository and documentation](https://github.com/scikit-rt/scikit-rt/blob/master/docs/markdown/installation.md)

## Usage
### Running the Classification Pipeline
1. Define the trial and dose prescription parameters.
2. Run the script to process patient data; example code for the pipeline can be found in the classification_workflow.ipynb
3. The results, including classification outputs and visualisation images, will be automatically saved in the `results` directory.

### Code Structure
- **import_analysis.py**: for additional analysis on the import breast cancer trial, additional functionality was incorporated which can be found in this python script. 
- **classification_classes.py**: Defines classification classes and methods.
- **results/**: Directory tores output data.

### Detailed Steps Performed by the Code
1. **Load Patient Data**:
   - Reads patient images and structure sets.
   - Determines the appropriate dose prescription based on trial arms.
     
2. **Register Images**:
   - Aligns the patientâ€™s imaging data for consistency.
   - Uses `Registration_Step` to match fixed and moving scans.

3. **Transform and Process Structures**:
   - Identifies and isolates the **Clinical Target Volume (CTV)**.
   - Transforms recurrence structures based on registration parameters.
   - Creates synthetic structures (e.g., **relapse sphere**) for analysis.

4. **Classify Treatment Plans**:
   - Determines the **treatment arm** for each patient.
   - Classifies recurrence structures based on dose exposure.
   - Stores results in CSV format for further analysis.

5. **Visualisation**:
   - Generates visual representations of dose fields and structures.
   - Uses `BetterViewer` from the scikit-rt python package to overlay relevant structures onto medical images.

## Configuration
Modify the trial parameters in the jupyter notebook example to customise the analysis for the relevant trial data:
- trial: The name of your trial (e.g., "trial_A", "trial_B").
- working_dir: The main directory the classification notebook and code for additional functionality is located. 
- data_dir: The directory where your raw patient trail data is stored.
- output_dir: The directory where you want to store output files.
- pfile_dir: The directory where the parameter files for Elastix are located.
- elastix_dir: The installation directory for Elastix (details can be found in the scikit-rt Registration documentation). 
- control_arm: The dose prescription for the control arm (if relevant).
- trial_arm_one: The dose prescription for trial arm one (if relevant).
- trial_arm_two: The dose prescription for trial arm two (if relevant).
- recurrence_dict: The dictionary for tumour volume and recurrence-related keywords.
- comparison_struct_dict: The dictionary for structure-related keywords (e.g., sternum, carina, spinal cord, these will vary depending on cancer site).
- ctv_names: The dictionary for tumour bed (CTV_TB) names in different formats as denoted by the delineating clinician(s). 


## Output
The pipeline generates:
- **Classifications CSV files** per patient and for all patients.
- **Transformed imaging structures**.
- **Plots and visualisations** for treatment evaluation.

## Future Development

Plans for future development include applications to cancer sites outside of breast cancer and head-and-neck cancer trials, refining image registration techniques, and expanding compatibility for alternative imaging modalities such as MRI.
