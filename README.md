# Spatially Mapping Locoregional Cancer Recurrence 

A Python-based framework for patient data classification and treatment planning analysis using Scikit-RT.

## Overview
This project provides a set of tools for processing, classifying, and analysing patient imaging and treatment data using Scikit-RT. It includes modules for:
- **Patient data import and management**: Loads patient imaging and associated metadata.
- **Image registration**: Aligns medical images from different scans to a common reference frame.
- **Structure transformation**: Adjusts structures to match registered images.
- **Dose prescription analysis**: Compares treatment plans and radiation doses to expected values.
- **Classification of recurrence structures**: Identifies recurrence patterns based on dose response.
- **Visualisation of treatment planning data**: Generates plots and overlays structures onto images.

## Features
- Uses Python package **scikit-rt** for performing image registration of planning CT and relapse CT scans for radiotherapy patients. 
- Determines the optimal spatial mapping transform, and stores the results of the registration in a results directory defined by the user. 
- Spatially maps structures outlined by clinicians from the relapse CT to the planning CT for comparison with radiotherapy dose field data.
- Applies uncertainty quantification methods to determine error in spatial mapping transform and applies to the centroid of the mapped recurrence volume.
- Generates synthetic spherical structure around the recurrence centroid with radius of the quantified uncertainty for comparison to planned radiotherapy dose field. 
- Classifies recurrence based on spatial location and dose delivered to the recurrence sphere. 
- Outputs patient classification data for further analysis. 
- Provides visualisation tools for treatment planning evaluation and comparison with other treatment covariates. 

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10.13
- scikit-rt 0.7.2
 
For further details on the installation of scikit-rt please reference the scikit-rt repository and documentation. 

## Usage
### Running the Classification Pipeline
1. Define the trial and dose prescription parameters.
2. Run the script to process patient data; example code for the pipeline can be found in the classification_workflow.ipynb
3. The results, including classification outputs and visualisation images, will be automatically saved in the `results` directory.

### Code Structure
- **import_analysis.py**: for additional analysis on the import breast cancer trial, additional functionality was incorporated which can be found in this python script. 
- **classification_classes.py**: Defines classification classes and methods.
- **results/**: Directory tores output data.

### Detailed Steps Performed by the Code
1. **Load Patient Data**:
   - Reads patient images and structure sets.
   - Determines the appropriate dose prescription based on trial arms.
     
2. **Register Images**:
   - Aligns the patientâ€™s imaging data for consistency.
   - Uses `Registration_Step` to match fixed and moving scans.

3. **Transform and Process Structures**:
   - Identifies and isolates the **Clinical Target Volume (CTV)**.
   - Transforms recurrence structures based on registration parameters.
   - Creates synthetic structures (e.g., **relapse sphere**) for analysis.

4. **Classify Treatment Plans**:
   - Determines the **treatment arm** for each patient.
   - Classifies recurrence structures based on dose exposure.
   - Stores results in CSV format for further analysis.

5. **Visualisation**:
   - Generates visual representations of dose fields and structures.
   - Uses `BetterViewer` from the scikit-rt python package to overlay relevant structures onto medical images.

## Configuration
Modify the following parameters in the jupyter notebook example to customise the analysis for the relevant trial data. 

## Output
The pipeline generates:
- **Classifications CSV files** per patient and for all patients.
- **Transformed imaging structures**.
- **Plots and visualisations** for treatment evaluation.

## Licence
This project is licensed under the MIT Licence.


## Future Development

Plans for future development include applications to cancer sites outside of breast cancer and head-and-neck cancer trials, refining image registration techniques, and expanding compatibility for alternative imaging modalities such as MRI.

This pipeline is designed to streamline and standardise radiomics analysis, from data import through image registration and recurrence tumour volume classification, in a reproducible and scalable framework for clinical research applications.
